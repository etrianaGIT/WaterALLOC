# WaterALLOC User Connection
## Water Resources Modeling Management System User Connection

WaterALLOC is a modeling management system that provides a new geographic information system (GIS)-based interface that streamline the data processing between **HydroBID** and **MODSIM** models, offering a solution to perform water availability analysis, including river and reservoir operations with simulation of water permits and priorities, using all the river operations tools and customization provided by MODSIM. WaterALLOC was created to enhance the user experience for both, HydroBID and MODSIM users, allowing the HydroBID user to use the GIS interface to run the system and adding easy-to-use input dialogs for agricultural and municipal demands for MODSIM. Additionally, his tool creates the MODSIM simulation network automatically from the Analytical Hydrology Dataset (**AHD**) network built for HydroBID, using the catchments and streams to define the links and nodes of the MODSIM network.
