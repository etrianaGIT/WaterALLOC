The new module will allow using the hydrologic processes simulated in Hydro-BID and import them directly into MODSIM to perform simulation of water allocation and system operations, based on water use priorities, water rights, water permits, storage operation rules, and administrative and social constraints. The new robust modeling platform will strengthen RTI\u2019s river basin management offerings, including streamlined data management between the models, ability to simulate responses and alternatives in complex systems, evaluate water availability including priorities and operations, and evaluate impacts of climate change and benefits of adaptation measures.

The file headers format allow flexibility in importing different time series types in different units to different MODSIM objects. File Format The csv file separate values with commas. The first row should include: * The first two columns contain the Start Date and the End Date , which corresponds to the start date and end date of period for which the data is provided. The MODSIM time series use the start date as time stamp of the interval. The exception is the storage targets that corresponds to the end of the period. * Name of the MODSIM objects separated by commas. Start Date, End Date, Object Names .... This first row is used to find the MODSIM objects, i.e., links or nodes. The name should match the name of the object in the model. The date format is MM/dd/YYYY The default time series for the different model object are: Additional Information This additional information define the type of time series to be imported for the object and the units. 1. The second row can contain the MODSIM variable names of the time series. The allowed variable names are: Variable Object Description adaTargetsM Reservoir Storage target time series. This time series is imported using the End Date . adaInflowsM Non-Storage Inflow time series adaEvaporationsM Reservoir Net evaporation rate time series (units of depth per time step). This time series is a decimal type, so it is imported without the accuracy factor. adaDemandsM Demand Water demand time series maxVariable Link Link capacity time series adaMeasured Link Measured flow time series adaForecastsM Reservoir Forecasted inflow to the reservoir adaGeneratingHrsM Reservoir Hydropower generating hours time series (units of hours) adaInfiltrationsM Demand fraction of the demand that infiltrates to the ground time series These variables names are case sensitive.
